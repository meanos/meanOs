## meanOs: (MEAN OPERATING SYSTEM)

meanOs is the most powerful operating system available, it is also the smallest

The first decentralized, artificially intelligent, MEAN stack, operating system, developed by don Pablo @ OBEYi.com using the MEAN.js Stack. meanOs is the only operating system hosted anonymous using a P2P network and a suite of non-standard in-browser delivery mechanisms such as - [Gun](https://gun.eco) and - [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

## GUI Options:

- [x] Google Fuchsia, Fuchsia is an open-source capability-based operating system currently being developed by Google. It first became known to the public when the project appeared on a self hosted form of git in August 2016 without any official announcement.

- [x] Kali Linux, Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.

- [x] macOS, macOS is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows.


## Architecture

A - [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) is used as a way to persist the censorship circumvention library after the initial visit to the participating website.

After the ServiceWorker is downloaded and activated, it handles all `fetch()` events by first trying to use the regular HTTPS request to the original website. If that fails (for whatever reason, be it timeout, or a `4xx`/`5xx` error), the plugins kick-in, attempting to fetch the content via any means are available.
